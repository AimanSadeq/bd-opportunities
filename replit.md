## Production Upgrade Status

### âœ… Option A: Real Authentication System (COMPLETED - Sep 30, 2025)

**Implemented:**
- Removed all temporary authentication bypasses (quick admin login, demo credentials, development bypass)
- Enabled proper Supabase email/password authentication
- Created admin user management panel (admin-users.html)
- Implemented password reset functionality  
- Added User Management module to admin navigation
- Security hardening: Only anon key exposed, no service role key in client code
- Admin setup documentation: See ADMIN-SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md

**Next Steps Available:**
- **Option B**: Deploy to Production - Make portal live with public URL
- **Option C**: Complete Security Hardening - Enable RLS policies, audit logging, security headers

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Pure client-side application with no build process
- **Modular Design**: Separate HTML files for each role and functionality (consultant module, BD module, main dashboard)
- **Pre-render Security**: Authentication checks executed immediately on page load before content display
- **Role-based Routing**: Different entry points based on user roles with universal route guards

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based Authentication**: Persistent login sessions with automatic refresh
- **Role-based Access Control**: Three distinct roles (consultant, bd, admin) with module-specific access
- **Pre-render Protection**: Content hidden until authentication is verified to prevent unauthorized access
- **Universal Route Guards**: Centralized security system protecting all non-public pages

### Data Management
- **Supabase Integration**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- **Client-side Data Layer**: JavaScript modules handle database operations and state management
- **Environment Configuration**: Template-based environment variable system for secure credential management

### Security Implementation
- **Environment Variable Protection**: Credentials stored in Replit secrets, not in code
- **Session Validation**: Automatic session expiry checking and renewal
- **Route Protection**: All protected pages require valid authentication before rendering
- **Secure Initialization**: Multi-step authentication verification on application startup

### Application Structure
- **Public Pages**: Login and landing pages accessible without authentication
- **Protected Modules**: Role-specific dashboards and functionality requiring authentication
- **Test Framework**: Built-in system testing capabilities for production validation
- **Deployment Ready**: Configured for one-click deployment to Replit hosting platform

## External Dependencies

### Core Infrastructure
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database hosting, authentication services, and real-time subscriptions
- **Replit**: Application hosting platform and development environment

### Frontend Libraries
- **@supabase/supabase-js**: Official Supabase JavaScript client for database and auth operations
- **Google Fonts (Open Sans)**: Typography and font loading for consistent branding

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for package management and tooling (v14.0.0+)

### Browser APIs
- **Web Storage API**: Session persistence and local data caching
- **Fetch API**: HTTP requests for database operations and authentication
